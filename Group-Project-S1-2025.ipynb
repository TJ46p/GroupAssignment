      " 'YOUR HOST: GARY COPOLOV \\n\\nHello, my name is Gary and I live in Middle Park, Melbourne.\\n\\nI currently manage over twenty inner bay side short to long term accommodation properties located in Middle Park, Albert Park, South Melbourne, Port Melbourne, St.Kilda, Balaclava, Elwood and even one property in North Carlton and Torquay.\\n\\nThose in the \"hood\" know that these locations are arguably some of Melbourne’s best and most desirable inner-city suburbs. I believe I am fortunate to live and manage properties in the area and to meet and host so many wonderful guests. \\n\\nMy Airbnb hosting journey started when my wife, Jo and I bought Florence Court in Nimmo Street, Middle Park in 2015. It is a heritage listed, mid 30\\'s Art Deco apartment block in where I now offer four fantastic short term accommodation apartments. I now operate sixteen brilliant short to long term accommodation properties in the area ranging from apartments to houses and from one to four bedrooms. They are all stunning and fitted out to the very highest standard. \\n\\nAs an Airbnb Superhost I offer my guests a concierge like service. I am an unashamed ambassador for the area where I have lived for over 30 years. Just tell me your interests and I will offer my recommendations. \\n\\nEach property has a copy of \"Adventures\" which provides details my recommended local To Do\\'s and the very best of nearby dining pleasures. There are many recommendations for guests of all ages. \\n\\nMy wife, Jo and I met playing tennis at Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club and were married in Paris just over 28 years ago. Jo is a part time teacher at the local primary school where she is a special education reading teacher. She has a real passion for books, real estate and interior design. A typical week will see her at a local café with friends, walking our dog in the nearby park, seeing a movie, attending her book club, doing a yoga class or shopping for the next thing for one of the properties we fitout and list on Airbnb. \\n\\nWe have two children, Louis and Natasha. Natasha (Tash) is a Project Co-ordinator in the construction industry. When she is not out socialising or getting away for the weekend, she may occasionally walk our friendly Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever called Hudson. We love pets and welcome them at all properties. \\n\\nOur son Louis lives in Portland, Maine, USA where he works for the Boston Celtics basketball team as Player Manager of the G League Maine Celtics.  He attended university in Boston, USA and represented Australia in rowing as a coxswain. \\n\\nOn weekends, given a chance, Jo and I visit a beach side get-away apartment with stunning sea views in Torquay, just over an hour’s drive from Melbourne. Torquay is Victoria\\'s surf capital and the gateway to the famous Great Ocean Road. The apartment is available for stays on Airbnb. (Sleeps 8). In Torquay, we enjoy walks, great local food, wine, the many surf beaches and the company of friends. \\n\\nWe have travelled to Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and the USA where we have enjoyed Airbnb hospitality in England, France, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, Croatia, Turkey, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and the United States. I wish to share that same pleasure and the excitement of travel with my guests. \\n\\nI am a self-employed Marketing Consultant whose consultancy, Gold Medal Marketing develops and implements winning business development programs for businesses in various industries. I have written and delivered a number of business development programs. \\n\\nWhen not hosting, I am working hard as the honorary Chairman of the Australian Patients Association (APA) which advocates, educates and supports Australian patients. The APA strives to be the voice of and for Australian patients. \\n\\nI regularly attend a local gym for regular workouts which I am pleased to introduce to my active guests. \\n\\nOn weekends in Winter, I watch St. Kilda, an Australian Rules Football Club as a long standing and sadly long-suffering club supporter and member.\\n\\nWith a family of building designers, I am always working on some property development or creative project for myself, family or and friends or for the property owners that I represent. \\n\\nI like to catch a movie or show and visit galleries and believing that you should “be a tourist in your own town” try get out and about to something interesting either near or far. \\n\\nI look forward to sharing the many great properties which I manage and my local experience with my guests. \\n\\nI am always available to ensure that property owners are well served by my services and that guests have a great stay. \\n\\nYours, \\n\\nGary Copolov.'\n",

One of the rooms has its own private lounge and balcony but other guests can enjoy the shared lounge room with fire and bay window.  \\n\\nApartments & Cottages\\nThe apartments and cottages that we offer are dotted around Williamstown and most are an easy walk to the restaurants, yacht-clubs and shops. They vary from 1-4 bedrooms and 1-3 bathrooms. (One apartment even has a 4th toilet). \\n\\nWe are not just offering a spare room in our house. This is our business and we are a dedicated team working to ensure that your stay is comfortable.  We are very careful about the apartments and cottages that we choose to take on and have refused many from owners wanting us to manage them.\\n\\nHaving said that, Williamstown is the oldest suburb in Melbourne and therefore some of the classic older apartments have décor such as shower over the bath. Whilst I would normally say no to venues like this, there are two apartments that have this but their other qualities so far outweigh that one negative and I quietly chip away at the owners in order for that to be changed.  I mention this because we want you to let us know if you have mobility issues so that we can suggest other venues for you. \\n\\nOther than beds (which are purchased to order and very comfortable!!), I love to buy antique and pre-loved furniture to fit certain venues and I have them restored using classic and sometimes quirky fabrics so you will not find a ‘hotel’ feel to our venues. Each one is quite different (some are Modern, some Victorian and some are Art-deco era). \\n\\nRe Dining: \\n\\nBreakfast: We provide a breakfast basket to guests staying in the apartments and cottages. Sadly due to restrictions related to covid, we do not currently offer breakfast in the main house so have reduced prices accordingly and our house-guests enjoy very good breakfasts in one of our many local cafes / restaurants, all within 2-4 minutes of here. (There are three places that we particularly recommend for a great breakfast).   There is however a table set in the bay window and you are welcome to use (Email hidden by Airbnb) plementary Tea, coffee and biscuits are provided in all venues. \\n\\nDinner: There is an excellent choice of restaurants with a variety of cuisines all within walking distance to nearly all of the venues that we offer. \\n\\nI'm proud to say that we have won the last 7 awards for 'tourism' and/or 'hospitality' at the Hobsons Bay region Business excellence awards as well as taken out the People's Choice award for the state of Victoria twice in the last three awards. \\n\\nMost of our guests are businesspeople or travellers so you can be assured of a quiet, relaxing and private 'home award from home' experience. We want your accommodation to be comfortable and check-ins and check-outs easy so that you can get on with enjoying the reason that you are here.\\n\\nWe look forward to welcoming you to beautiful Williamstown. \\n\\nBest regards, \\n\\nMelissa and the team from Captains Retreat\\n\"\n",
